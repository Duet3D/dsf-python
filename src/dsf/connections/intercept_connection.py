class InterceptConnection(BaseCommandConnection):
    """
    Connection class for intercepting G/M/T-codes from the control server

    Constructor arguments:
    :param interception_mode: Mode of the interceptor
    :param channels: List of input channels where codes may be intercepted.
    If the list is empty, all available channels are used
    :param filters: List of G/M/T-codes to filter or Q0 for comments.
    This may only specify the code type and major/minor number (e.g. G1)
    :param auto_flush: Automatically flush the code channel before notifying the client
    in case a code filter is specified.
    This option makes extra Flush calls in the interceptor implementation obsolete.
    It is highly recommended to enable this in order to avoid potential deadlocks when dealing with macros!
    :param auto_evaluate_expression: Automatically evaluate expression parameters to their final values
    before sending it over to the client.
    This requires auto_flush to be True and happens when the remaining codes have been processed.
    :param priority_codes: Defines if priority codes may be intercepted (e.g. M122 or M999)
    :param debug: Whether debugging output is turned on for this connection
